/**
 * Application Routes
 *
 * Centralized route definitions using route configuration.
 * Routes are generated from configuration files for better maintainability.

 * Route optimization:
 * - Landing page and login stay in main bundle (critical path)
 * - Dashboard routes lazy loaded (heavy chunk)
 * - Onboarding routes lazy loaded (separate chunk)
 * - Analytics/Insights lazy loaded (heavy dependencies)
